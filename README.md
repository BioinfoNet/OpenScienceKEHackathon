# OpenScienceKE Hackathon

Planning for the OpenScienceKE Hackathon to be held on the 30th and 31st August at KENET Training room, JKML, UoN. 


## Introduction
Having trained on Open Science tools in our last [workshop](https://bioinfonet.github.io/OpenScienceKE/), this stage of the project seeks to foster collaboration among workshop attendees through a two-day hackathon, where they will get to experience the power of the wisdom of the crowds. In addition, this hackathon will afford the participants an opportunity to further solidify their skills while addressing questions of interest to the Open Science community in Kenya, and Africa as a whole.

## How to contribute
We are in the process of developing ideas for the hackathon. Our initial thoughts can be accessed in the [issues section](https://github.com/BioinfoNet/OpenScienceKEHackathon/issues). Hop in there to comment on the current ideas or suggest one by creating a new issue. The current ideas are:
1. Exploring the status of open science in Kenya through literature search and data mining.
     - Requires writing and ability to search literature
     - Data mining requires experience in R or Python for data analysis
2. A resource highlighting journals that offer low-cost open access options for the students to publish. 
     - Basic writing and literature search
3. What else can we explore?

## Hackathon Projects
The following projects have been selected for the hackathon:
1. [Status of open science in Kenya: Literature search](https://github.com/BioinfoNet/Status-of-OpenScienceKE-LiteratureSearch)
2. [Status of open science in Kenya: Data mining](https://github.com/BioinfoNet/Data-mining)
3. [Publishing open access at low cost: what are our options?](https://github.com/BioinfoNet/Openaccess-Options)

Check the linked repos to know more about the projects. Reach out to the team leaders if you can help out with any of the projects.

### What kind of projects are we interested in?
We looking for projects that:
   - Can be tackled within two days
   - Can be tackled by participants with entry to intermediate level coding skills
   - Address a Bioinformatics or Open Science question. Should not, however, require highly specialized Bioinformatics skills
Thank you for your interest. We already settled on the hackathon projects.
