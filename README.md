# OpenScienceKE Hackathon
Planning for the OpenScienceKE Hackathon to be held on 30th and 31st August at KENET Training room, JKML, UoN. 


## Introduction

## How to contribute
We are in the process of developing ideas for the hackathon. Our initial thoughts can be accessed in the [issues section](https://github.com/BioinfoNet/OpenScienceKEHackathon/issues). Hop in there to comment on the current ideas or suggest one by creating a new issue. The current ideas are:
1. Exploring the status of open science in Kenya through literature search and data mining.
  - Requires writing and ability to search literature
  - Data mining requires experience in R or Python for data analysis
2. A resource highlighting journals that offer low-cost open access options for the students to publish. 
  - Basic writing and literature search
3. What else can we explore?

The first project can be handled by two groups: a literature search and data mining.
